"""Background work for web forms.

A Celery worker does not run Django middleware, so `set_rls_context` has to be
called explicitly before any ORM query. Without it every query below runs with
an empty `app.current_org` and returns zero rows, which reads as "no submission
found" rather than as a bug.

    one email rather than two.

    Rejected submissions notify nobody. Telling an org about every bot that

    miss the real one.
