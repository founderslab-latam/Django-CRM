 * The ticket, plus what closing it would take with it.

 * The tree and the org settings are fetched ONLY for a ticket that has
 * children. Most tickets have none, and two extra requests on every ticket
 * open to answer a question that cannot arise is a cost paid for nothing.
 *
 * Neither extra is allowed to break the page: a ticket that will not render
 * because its tree call failed is a worse outcome than a close button that
 * falls back to the plain one. Both fall back quietly, and the close action
 * re-derives everything server-side anyway, so nothing here is trusted.
 *
 * The time entries ride along in the same wave. They are their own request,
 * the ticket envelope carries only the `time_summary` totals, and they are
 * allowed to fail: a ticket that will not render because the time panel could
 * not load is the same bad trade as the tree below. `null` means the fetch
 * failed and the panel says so; `[]` means nobody has logged anything.
